# How to give a great presentation

## How to organize a presentation
Organize a presentation is a combination of clear thinking and clear communication.
1. Keeps things simple -- keep them on target.
Start with specific, written objectives — and a strategy. You need a theme to give your presentation unity and direction, and to fix your purpose in your audience’s mind.
2. Tell your audience where you're going.
3. Think headlines, not labels.
Presenters often have impressive data on their charts, but fail to extract what the data shows, so the audience doesn’t understand what the numbers prove.
4. Invole the audience.
5. Finish strong.

## Speech that make a point
1. Frame the subject with a point of view.
2. Start fast.
3. Write your speech to be spoken.
4. Leave them thinking.
5. No speech was ever too short.
